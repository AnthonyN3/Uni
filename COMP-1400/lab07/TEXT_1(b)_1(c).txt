	Question 1(b)

	The reason why it will give a incorrect output for certain data types 
	is due to the value/integer being to high. Therefore it causes an 
	value overflow and starts giving incorrect outputs.
	
	2!
	Correct results for all data type

	3!
	Correct results for all data type

	4!
	Correct result for all data types

	5!
	Correct result for all data types
	
	6!
	Correct result for all data types
	
	7!
	Correct result for all data types
	
	8!
	Incorrect for: short
	
	9!,10!,11!,12! 
	Incorrect for: short, unsigned short

	13! --all the way to---> 20!
	Incorrect for: short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int
	
	
	25!,50!,70!
	Incorrect for: ALL but long double 
	(However only goes 5 decimal places instead of 9)
	
	100!,450!,1000!
	Incorrect for: ALL but long double 
	(However only goes 5 decimal places instead of 9)
	
	3249!, 10000!, 25206!, 100000!, 205023!, 100000!, 10^100!
	Incorrect for all data types 
	(Note: long double prints out "inf"(infinite) ) 
	
	
	1(c)
	
	You can use the data type "LongDouble" in order to find the exact factorial number that causes unsigned
	long long int to fail. THe number that causes it to fail is 21!
